        <p>I am so thankful to have you in my life. I really enjoy spending time with you, whether it's going out for lunch, hanging out at the house, or splashing you in the pool. &#x1F609; Jokes aside, you are an amazing aunt and you mean the world to me. With that being said, I would love to take you out for brunch at Keke's when your schedule is free. Happy Birthday from your favorite nephew! &#9829;</p>
